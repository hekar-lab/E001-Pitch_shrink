# Experiment NÂ°001 - Pitch shrinking

The goal of this experiment is to "shrink" the pitches contained in an audio signal.

Shrinking is the process by which pitches get closer to a designated reference pitch.
That is (using an example in the chromatic scale), if the reference pitch is A4 and the
shrinking is 0.5 (0 => no shrinking, 1 => any pitch = reference pitch) then pitches
below A4 will go up (e.g. A3 -> ~E4) and the pitches above will go down (e.g. A5 -> ~E5)

NB: This is subject to changes as much of the implementation is to be defined in the experimentation.
